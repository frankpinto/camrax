          (<em>The Marriage of Learning and Eloquence</em>) &nbsp;Written
          about c500 AD, this was a milestone in the development of literary allegory and
          personification, and a textbook description of each of the liberal arts as they
          were given by Mercury to his bride. It was popular throughout the Middle Ages
          and later; there were eight editions of this book between 1499 and 1599 and
          Leibniz himself contemplated editing an edition. Eds: Vienna: Victorem, 1516, Lyons: Raphelengius,

          A series of poems on the successive triumphs of Love,

          and Dante&#8217;s Commedia in popularity for more than 100 years. Inspired by
          the triumphal processions&nbsp;of the emperors and generals of Rome&nbsp;after their victories, they
          featured captives and attendants who were either personified allegorical
          figures or great men and women from the past
