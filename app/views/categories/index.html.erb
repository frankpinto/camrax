  <p id="blog-title">The Age of Symbolism</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2,000 years, from the time of 
Plato in 400 BC until the start of the modern era of empirical science 
in approximately 1600 AD, the culture of Western Europe was dominated by
 a single mode of expression: the symbol. The symbol was the universal 
medium for the approach to God, for the investigation of the natural 
world, for the interpretation of the Scriptures and for an understanding
 of and a guide to proper moral conduct. Towards the end of the period, 
enabled by the invention of printing by movable type, this obsession was
 translated into a vast literature of symbolism of which some eighty 
distinct species were identified by contemporary writers and theorists.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This web site is a bibliography of 
this literature of symbolism. By definition the common characteristic of
 the entries in the bibliography is that they are wholly or partly 
symbolic and not merely literal or descriptive: they say one thing but 
mean another, the underlying meaning is veiled by the apparent meaning, 
there is a signifier and a signified. Another characteristic of much of 
this literature is that it consists of collections of short pieces, a 
format consistent with the principal purpose of indicating a secondary 
meaning whether such meaning was intended to be mystical, moral or 
spiritual. The entry on <a href="http://www.camrax.com/symbol/apophthegmintro.php4">apophthegms</a>
 gives a brief outline of the development of this phenomenon which 
originated with the rhetorical requirement for student and writers to 
make collections of Authorities, this practice evolving in turn into a 
recognized literary undertaking of its own. Obviously there were 
exceptions to this rule such as the great allegorical epics of the age 
as well as theatrical performances and festivals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these literary species can be
 grouped into categories which indicate their common origin or 
relationship. Such groups include the species derived from heraldry such
 as arms, devices, insignia, mottos; those related to jokes including 
satires, testaments, paradoxes and others; divinations including dreams,
 prophesies, lotteries and visions; the performing arts including 
masques, festivals, burlesques and other dramatic writings. It is 
evident that some of these are not literary material but nevertheless 
they are included here because they were seen by contemporaries as 
symbolic species and were either collected into book form with 
commentaries on their allegorical nature or were included as 
illustrations in the many contemporary treatises on the nature of the 
symbol.</p>
